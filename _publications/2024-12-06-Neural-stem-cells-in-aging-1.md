Aging is intricately linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, with neural stem cells (NSCs) playing a crucial role in brain function maintenance and repair. We examine the age-related metabolic shifts in NSCs, such as alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and protein expression, and how these changes affect NSCs' function of neurogenesis. We discuss the functional decline in NSCs’ proliferation and self-renewal capacity, mainly in the hippocampus, and their implications for cognitive function and emotional regulation. We also highlight the potential of understanding these cellular changes within NSCs to develop novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries, emphasizing the importance of harnessing NSC therapy in aging-related conditions.
