In the aged brain, hippocampal NSCs undergo several changes that are related to cognitive decline and emotional disorder: 1) Aging impedes the transformation of metabolic patterns during qNSC activation, thus affecting the energy supply for neurogenesis. 2) Mitochondrial dynamics change during aging, ultimately contributing to cognitive decline and emotional disorders. 3) During aging, the number and function of qNSCs drop, which may be related to changed chromatin accessibility. 4) Aging impairs the adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and prevents the differentiation of NSCs into neurons and glial cells.
