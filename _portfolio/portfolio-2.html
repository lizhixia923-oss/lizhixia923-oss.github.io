excerpt: "Aging reduces astrocyte support and increases microglial IL-1β/TNFα, while hypoperfusion, leaky vessels, and ECM stiffening starve and inflame the NSC niche. <br/><img src='/images/neural_stem_cell_2.png'>"

During aging, astrocytes release fewer neurotrophic factors and interact with NSCs less while activated microglia release more pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNFα. Also, aging leads to lower blood flow and vascular permeability changes which means less nutrients and more circulating cytokines go into the NSC niche. Lastly, the extracellular matrix becomes stiffer during aging. The thickness of arrow represents intensity or severity.
