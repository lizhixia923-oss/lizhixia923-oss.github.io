Education
======
* Ph.D in Immunology, Peking University, 2029 (expected)
* B.S. in Basic Medicine, Peking University, 2026 (expected)

  
Skills
======
* Adobe illustrator: I am highly proficient in using Adobe Illustrator to create precise, publication-quality scientific figures, including complex schematics, data-driven diagrams, and visually compelling graphical abstracts; a curated gallery of these works is available in my online portfolio for your review.
* Programming Skills
  * R: Advanced proficiency in R for statistical analysis, data wrangling, and publication-ready visualization (ggplot2, tidyverse, Bioconductor); experienced with Shiny dashboards and R Markdown reports.  
  * Python：Familiar with basic data manipulation and plotting (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for simple analytical tasks.
  * C: Comfortable writing small performance-critical routines and integrating them via Cython when needed.
* Experimental Techniques:
  * Behavioral Neuroscience: Skilled in designing and executing a battery of rodent behavioral paradigms, including open-field and elevated-plus-maze tests for anxiety-like phenotypes, rat maternal-behavior assays, mouse contextual/cued fear-conditioning for learning & memory, and chronic-stress depression modeling in mice.
  * Histology & Molecular Anatomy: Proficient in transcardial perfusion, rapid brain dissection, and cryo-sectioning of rat tissue (10–40 µm). Subsequent pipeline: antigen-retrieval, blocking, multi-channel primary/secondary antibody incubation, mounting with antifade media, and confocal imaging for high-resolution immunofluorescence quantification.
  * Cell Culture: Aseptic culture, passage, and cryopreservation of adherent and suspension mammalian lines; stable-transfection selection and routine mycoplasma screening.
  * Western Blot: Full workflow—lysis (RIPA + inhibitors), BCA quantification, SDS-PAGE, wet/tank transfer, blocking, optimized primary/secondary antibody probing, ECL detection, and quantitative densitometry with ImageJ.
  * Molecular Cloning: Gibson- and restriction-ligation–based plasmid design, site-directed mutagenesis, colony PCR screening, midi/maxi-prep with endotoxin-free kits, Sanger sequencing validation, and CRISPR/Cas9 guide-RNA cloning for downstream gene-editing experiments.
